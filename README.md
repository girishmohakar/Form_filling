# 🌐 Basic HTML Input Form Project

This is a beginner-friendly HTML project I created to understand and explore various types of `<input>` elements used in web forms.

## 🚀 What I Learned

This project helped me practice the structure and usage of common HTML form input types:

- **Text Input** (`<input type="text">`) – for name and address  
- **Date Picker** (`<input type="date">`) – to select date of birth  
- **Range Slider** (`<input type="range">`) – for age selection  
- **Checkbox** (`<input type="checkbox">`) – to confirm consent  
- **File Upload** (`<input type="file">`) – to upload photo and signature  
- **Button** (`<button>`) – to simulate form submission  

## 🧠 Purpose

This mini project is not about complex functionality but about getting familiar with:

- HTML structure
- Different input elements
- Basic layout using simple tags like `<b>`, `<br>`, `<div align="right">`, and more
